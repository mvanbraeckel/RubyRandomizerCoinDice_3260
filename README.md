## A Game of Coins and Dice feat. Bags, Cups, and Hands

Please note that where the A1 documentation and/or the posted Q&A was not sufficient, I took my own liberties. This being said, it's nothing too severe. For example, where applicable in an "abstract" class, a function is sometimes not implemented but is by its child(ren). In addition, in some places I opt to raise an error for invalid arguments. Furthermore, some things (like those involving descriptions) will succeed silently even when bad info is passed in (i.e. it filters based on those bad keys and/or values and doesn't find anything)
