require "./Randomizer.rb"

# Coin <inherits from Randomizer>
# NOTE: enum used for coin denominations = 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 1, 2
# NOTE: enum used for coin sides = :H, :T
# Description example: {item: :coin, denomination: 0.25, up: :H}
# Note 1: Int and Enum are only indications of the arg types expected by the method.
# -> They will not be present in your code as Ruby is Duck typed.
# -> UML type notation has been used, with the type following the arg name, separated by a colon
# Note 2: Enum is not actually a class; it is a duck-type-style interface, i.e. a protocol.
# -> E.g. colour is consistently represented by symbols such as `:red` and `:blue`;
# -> There is no class holding or enforcing these values (although they can be error checked against by the methods that accept them, if you wish).
# -> All enumeration protocolsare listed in the "Enumerations" section later in the assignment
