===============================================
USE CASE #1 : D&D "Backstabber" Attack
===============================================
Primary Actor: Dirk Deacon, D&D Player
Goal: Makes a melee attack from behind a creature while hidden
Initiating Event:
- Dirk is playing D&D
- Dirk has exactly 1 coin, 3d20, and 1d8 in his bag
- Dirk's cup, which he uses for coin flips and die rolls, is empty
- Dirk's character is hiding successful without being noticed
- Dirk's character melee attacks the target from behind
- Dirk's character's melee attack does 1d8 damage
Main Success Scenario:
- Dirk's character possesses at least one use left of its homebrew Backstabber Feat
- Dirk chooses to activate his homebrew Backstabber Feat for the melee attack from behind while hidden
- Dirk removes his 1 coin from his bag and adds it to his cup in preparation to use as part of the Backstabber feat attack roll
- Dirk removes 3d20 from his bag and adds it to his cup in preparation to use as part of the Backstabber feat attack roll
- Dirk throws the contents of his cup to make the attack roll, making note of the throw's results
- Dirk then puts the 1 coin and 3d20 back into his bag
- Dirk removes 1d8 from his bag and adds it to his cup in preparation to use as part of the damage roll
- Dirk throws the contents of his cup to make the damage roll, making note of the throw's results
- Dirk then puts the 1d8 back into his bag
Post Conditions:
- Dirk has a total of 2 separate cup throw-rolls
- Dirk has flipped 1 coin
- Dirk has rolled 3d20 dice
- Dirk has rolled 1d8 dice
- Dirk's cup is empty
- Dirk's bag once again contains the 1 coin, 3d20, and 1d8
Alternate Flows or Exceptions / Scenario Notes:
- If the coin flip is heads, the attack hits regardless of the "special advantage" 3d20 attack roll
- If the coin flip is tails and the "special advantage" 3d20 attack roll still misses, the 1d8 damage roll is halved (rounded down)
- If any of the 3d20s are a natural 20, the 1d8 damage roll is doubled

===============================================
USE CASE #2 : Bag of lost coins leads to buying a lottery ticket
===============================================
- finds a bag of coins, counts the sum, if > X, he'll buy a lottery ticket with it
